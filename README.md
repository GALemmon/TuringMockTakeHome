## Overview:

This is a mock take hom challenge from Turing.  The spec sheet is [here](https://mod4.turing.edu/projects/take_home/take_home_fe).  This attempt represents a little under seven hours of work.  I elected to shoot for minimum viable product with minimal styling.  I ran into problems with implementing dynamic urls for the detailed article views, so I elected to utilize conditional rendering to meet the requirement in the interest of staying within the time constraints.  Given some additional time, it should be something that could be fixed.
